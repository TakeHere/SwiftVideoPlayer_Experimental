# SwiftVideoPlayer (Experimental and Old)

[❗]: I basically got an idea, videos are just a succession of images, so if I can display images fast, it's basically a video\
[⚠️]: This experiment is basically that: Display a video by successively showing images (this is only an experiment)

[❓]: The inner workings is pretty simple 🠪 Using FFMPG, it cuts the video and save all it's frame in a folder where it will be later read and displayed to the user in a fast and successive way
